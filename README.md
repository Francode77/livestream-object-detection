# Livestream object detection

## Scope:
*This is a personal project to learn using computer vision object detection.*

## Project Description:
 Live object detection on a youtube livestream with Yolov5. The app runs locally in a web browser.

[A demo version](https://francode77-livestream-object-detection-youtube-od-24bdil.streamlit.app/) is online on Streamlit cloud.
 
# Requirements
  
  - Python 3.7.9
  - Pytorch
  - CUDA and CuNN  
  - Yolov5
  - Streamlit

# Installation

 - Create and activate a virtual env
 - Install the necessary libraries from the requirements.txt file in the main folder 
`
# Usage 

type `streamlit run youtube_od.py` in terminal

# Method
 
 With the Yolo v5 pretrained model we can detect 80 types of objects.

# Results

 Here is a screenshot of the current version
